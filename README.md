## How to run all things

### Before you start
* Install docker and docker compose

### Run 
```$xslt
docker-compose up --build
```
## How to use

#### Create short url from long url
```
POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/shortUrl
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "longUrl" : "https://www.google.com"
}
```
#### Short url response
```
HTTP/1.1 201 
Content-Type: application/json
    
{
  "shortUrl": "Ny1"
}
```

#### Redirect to long url 
```
GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/shortUrl/Ny1
```
#### Redirection response
```
Redirections:
-> https://www.google.com/
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

### Services
* Implemented Docker and Docker compose for deployment.
* Implemented unit testing and integration testing using JUnit, Mockito and Testcontainers.
* Implemented swagger documentation

### Url shortener service
* Improved the performance by implementing Redis caching in the application, resulting in faster response times.
* Utilized MongoDB as the database for the Url Shortener service, resulting in improved performance and scalability, as well as easier implementation of features such as sharding and replica sets.
* If one range service goes down, other instances will be tried by OpenFeign.
* Implemented url validation
* [Swagger UI](http://localhost:5200/swagger-ui/index.html/)

### Range service
* Utilized Pessimistic locking in JPA for the Range service to share range without concurrency problem for multiple instances of Url shortener service.
* [Swagger UI](http://localhost:5200/swagger-ui/index.html/) 

### Config server
* Implemented Spring Cloud Config Server to store and manage configuration properties for multiple microservices.
* Spring Cloud Bus with RabbitMQ enables automatic reload of configuration changes across all instances of a microservice architecture, reducing downtime and increasing availability.
1. Push commits in config repository
2. Send request: POST http://localhost:8888/actuator/busrefresh

### Observability 
* Utilized Prometheus, Grafana, and Node exporter to monitor system performance and resource usage in real-time, allowing for proactive identification and resolution of potential issues.
* Implemented Zipkin for distributed tracing of microservices, helping to identify and diagnose performance issues within complex systems.
* Grafana setup:
1. Add Prometheus data source with url http://host.docker.internal:9090
2. Upload JSON file from observability/prometheus/grafana-dashboard.json

### Api Gateway 
* Utilized the Spring Cloud API Gateway to effectively manage and route traffic across multiple microservices, resulting in improved performance and scalability of the overall system.

### Discovery server
* Improved scalability and availability of services by using Eureka server for dynamic service discovery and load balancing.
